# 🧠 About COD Mobile Central

COD Mobile Central was built by and for the community — not a corporation. We’re all about **clean, fast, no-nonsense communication** for players who love Call of Duty Mobile.

## 🎯 Our Mission
To be the chillest, realest, and most tactical chat space for:
- Loadout builds and weapon talk
- Strategy, map control, and team tactics
- Casual lobbies, 1v1s, or just shooting the breeze

No paywalls. No popups. Just IRC — in a format that actually works.
