We get asked these a lot. Got a question? It might be here.

### 🔹 How do I join the chat?
Just head over to the [Chat](/chat) page, pick a nickname, and you're in. No account needed.

### 🔹 What is IRC?
IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It’s fast, simple, and old-school — perfect for live gamer chat.

### 🔹 Why not use Discord?
We love Discord, but IRC is open, customizable, and doesn't require accounts, apps, or tracking. Plus, it runs on anything.

### 🔹 Can I become a mod?
Maybe. Start by being active, helpful, and respectful in chat. If we're looking for mods, we’ll ask the community.

### 🔹 Will there be events or giveaways?
Yes! Check the [Events](/events) page and join chat for live announcements.

### 🔹 Do I need to install anything to chat?
Nope. The chat runs in your browser using KiwiIRC. Just pick a name and go.

### 🔹 Is this official?
No — this is a **fan-made community project** for CODM players. We’re not affiliated with Activision.
