# 📜 COD Mobile Central – Community Rules

We’re chill — but not lawless. Respect these simple rules and everyone has a good time.

## 🚫 No-Nos (Instant Kick or Ban)
- ❌ Racism, hate speech, or slurs
- ❌ Spam or flooding the channel
- ❌ Doxxing, harassment, or threats
- ❌ Promoting cheats, hacks, or exploits

## 💬 Chat Etiquette
- Keep language respectful — PG-13 is a good guide
- No ALL CAPS yelling unless you're getting nuked 😉
- Use English (or common sense) in public channels
- Don’t argue with mods — take it private or to GitHub

## 🔫 Game-Specific Stuff
- Want to 1v1? Ask respectfully — don’t demand
- Share loadouts and clips in the right channels (or use a paste site)
- Cheaters get banned — even if it’s “just for fun”

## 👮‍♂️ Enforcement
Admins may kick/ban without warning for serious stuff. We do our best to be fair, but we also move fast to keep things clean.

Want to appeal a ban or report abuse? [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HiggsInc/codmobilecentral/issues) or ping an admin on IRC.

**This is your server. Keep it clean. Keep it COD.**
